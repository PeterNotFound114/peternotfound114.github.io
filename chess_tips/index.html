            <h2>Where to Start Playing</h2>
            <p>
                Chess may sound complex and difficult to learn for many people. While
                it is indeed a complex game to which one can devote a lifetime, start
                learning it only takes a chess set and a calm mind. Here're a few tips
                if you are new to chess.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <p>
                First and most importantly, buy a chess set! While you can get lichess
                and chess.com on a smartphone or laptop, playing chess online does not
                makes the experience of playing chess whole. Even though they are still
                strongly recommended when trying to learn chess and analyze previous games,
                playng chess over a real board differs greatly from playing online. While
                online chess removes most physical restrictions of playing chess, it often
                encourages a rushed game style where both sides race to not blunder first.
                On the other hand, playing chess on a real board calms people down with
                the feeling of touching pieces and sitting down to really calculate moves.
                Therefore, getting a chess set can really help you access the feeling of time
                zooming past while you emerge yourselves in a game.
            </p>

            <p>
                Further, try playing with people around you. An indispensible part of chess's
                charm comes from building bridges between people. To do this, you can join a
                local chess club, check out chess stands in night markets, or simply ask a
                person you see playing chess to have a game. You'll be surprised about how
                quickly chess can bring different people together and how enjoyable that process is.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="">

            <p>
                Last but not least, use the Internet! With a smartphone and a laptop,
                you can access chess content and top engines that were not available to
                players 20 years ago. Analyze your games with an online engine works
                faster and better than sitting down for hours trying to analyze the game
                without it. Subscribe to chess streamers and following top competitions
                can also bring new ideas of chess. I will go more in depth of that in
                the "Common Tips" section.

            <img src="" alt="King Move">

            <p>
                The King can move 1 square in any other direction. It's the most important
                piece and must be protected at all costs. When a king can be captured by a piece
                of the opponent next turn assuming no moves are made in between, it is called a
                "check," and the player being "checked" must resolve the check by
                either move the king out of check, take the checking piece, or block the
                checking piece's access to the king.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Queen Move">

            <p>
                The Queen can move in any number of squares in any direction. It's the second
                most important piece and is worth 9 points when measuring material advantage.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Rook Move">

            <p>
                The Rook can move in any number of squares along a straight file. It's considered
                an endgame piece and is worth 5 points when measuring material advantage.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Bishop Move">

            <p>
                The Bishop can move in any number of squares along a diagonal. It's developed
                early game and is worth 3 points when measuring material advantage.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Knight Move">
            <p>
                The Knight can jump to a square that is 2 squares ahead and 1 square to either
                the left and the right. It can jump over pieces and often comes with the element
                of surprise. It's also developed early game and is worth 3 points when measuring
                material advantage.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Pawn Move">
            <p>
                The Pawn can move 1 square straight ahead but captures 1 suqare ahead diagonally.
                When it moves for the first time &#40; but not after capturing &#41;, it may move 2 squares ahead.
                When it reaches the opposite side of the board it must promote to a Queen, a Rook,
                a Bishop, or a Knight. It is worth 1 point when it comes to measuring material advantage.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Castling Kingside">
            <img src="" alt="Castling Queenside">
            <p>
                Castling is a special move that happens usually in early game. It moves the king directly
                into safety by moving the king 2 squares and the rook of the corresponding side over the king
                to the square on the other side adjacent to the king. Yet there are a few prerequisites for the
                move: no pieces between the king and rook; no enemy piece can move to a square where the king will
                traverse during castling; the king must not be in check; and the castling king and rook have not moved.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="En Passant">
            <p>
                When a pawn moves 2 squares for the first time, if there is a pawn of the opponent on
                the same rank after the pawn has moved, the opponent's pawn may capture the pawn as if
                it moved only 1 square. This is called "En Passant," yet it can only be done the move
                immediately after the pawn have moved 2 squares.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Checkmate">
            <p>
                When one of the players cannot resolve a check, that player is "checkmated." The
                player who checkmates the opponent wins.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Stalemate">
            <p>
                Sometimes a chess game ends in a draw. This can happen either by repeating the
                same position 3 times, having no pawns and no more than 3 points of material in
                total on the board, take 50 turns without capturing or promoting, or one side having
                no legal moves &#40; of course, you may not pass a move in a chess game, so this is
                a "stalemate" &#41;

        <h2>Common Tips</h2>
        <p>
            After learning the basic moves, go play chess! Learning chess is impossible if
            you only play puzzles but not real players. While you play, there are a few things
            to bear in mind:
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            1&#40; Assume that your opponents will play the best move. If they occasionally
            blunder, take advantage of that immediately. Yet, such blunders are relatively rare,
            and they only become rarer as your skill levels increase. So compute as if your
            opponent makes the best <i>human</i> move possible &#40;unless, of course, when you're
            playing <a href="">Mittens on chess.com</a>&#41;&#46;
            <!-- hyperlink to Mittens the chess bot-->
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            2&#40; If time permits &#40;that is, you are not in a blitz or bullet game&#41;, try to
            come up with a few candidate moves before commiting your move. Do not immediately
            make the first plausible move that comes to your mind! Compare between each move
            and then pick the one that offers the best continuation for you!
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            3&#40; Common ways to decide which move is best: Is there anything that I must
            immediately address &#40;i.e., check, hanging piece&#41;&#63; If not, what can I do
            to improve my position&#63; Do consider your long-term strategies - what will I do
            after making this check&#63; Can I threaten checkmate if I open up this file or
            diagonal&#63;
