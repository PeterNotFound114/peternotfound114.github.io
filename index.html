        Theme: Queen's Gambit - Background and Basic Theory
        In this assignment, I will focus on the basic chess theories and major 
        variations behind the chess opening Queen's Gambit, with a slight divergence 
        to the background and exigence of the series Queen's Gambit, and some 
        advice on how to learn chess from the perspective of a lifelong chess player.

                The Netfilx series <i>Queen's Gambit</i> probably sounds familiar to you. It tells
                the story of a fictional female chess prodigy who defeated not only chess players
                but also cruel fate and constricting social norms to become the world champion. I
                strongly recommend watching the show if you have not already done so as not only
                the plot is cohesive but also the incredible details about chess &#40; the
                director consulted Garry Kasparov for games of chess to include in the show &#41;&#46;

                Yet, what exactly is the opening Queen's Gambit in chess? This is the question that
                I try to answer today. Although there will be a table of chess theories about the
                opening, I also included tips for playing chess and rule of chess in the chess tips
                page to help you understand better. If you would like to go more in depth of the
                theories or play a game of chess, feel free to reach out via email or chess&#46;com&#33;
