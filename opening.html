        Theme: Queen's Gambit - Background and Basic Theory
        In this assignment, I will focus on the basic chess theories and major 
        variations behind the chess opening Queen's Gambit, with a slight divergence 
        to the background and exigence of the series Queen's Gambit, and some 
        advice on how to learn chess from the perspective of a lifelong chess player.

                                This line tends to lead to a very sharp position, as black can easily
                                develop their pieces towards the center while preparing for an early
                                attack on the center with e5. Yet white can also play actively by either
                                3. e4 or the more canonical 3. Nf3, preparing to activate the bishops
                                and take over the center. As white is down a pawn, it must play for more
                                activity and space in the center as compensation.

                                This line leads to a more solid and positional play as black declines
                                to weaken his center by taking the gambit. Although black's light-squared
                                bishop is blocked, his two knights can still develop towards their natural
                                positions on c6 and f6. White can also develop his knights in similar ways
                                to pressure black's d5 pawn or go for a pin with Bg5 after Nf6 is played
                                by black. Although taking d5 with the c-pawn seems tempting for white as
                                it will give white an extra pawn in the center, it is not that promising as
                                it relieves the pressure on d5 square and related tactical plays.

                                This line tends to lead to a balanced position as black consolidates the center
                                with his c-pawn while making capturing the c4 pawn a more feasible possibility.
                                While white can develop both knights to their natural positions, black's queen side
                                knight
                                cannot develop to the more natural c6 square. Yet compared to Queen's Gambit Declined,
                                black's light square bishop remained open to development.

                                This is the line played by Borgov against Beth Harmon in their last match. Typically,
                                this line leads to a sharp position as black tries to divert white's d-pawn by
                                sacrificing his e-pawn, thereby enabling 3. ... d4. White usually takes the gambit
                                instead of playing 3.e3 as that allows black to equalize with a solid center. There are
                                many traps
                                associated with this position, such as the most notable <a

                                where white loses material immediately after playing
                                4. e3?.
