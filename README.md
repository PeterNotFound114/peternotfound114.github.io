Theme: Queen's Gambit - Background and Basic Theory

As an avid chess player, I am thrilled when I heard that the series Queen's Gambit is
released, and I am compelled to write some of my thoughts on the chess opening as well
(since it's my favorite opening as white).In this assignment, I will focus on the basic 
chess theories and major variations behind the chess opening Queen's Gambit, some 
advice on how to learn chess from the perspective of a lifelong chess player, and online
resources that I find particularly helpful to learning chess.

For the development process, I first drew a lo-fi prototype to help me organize my thoughts
and information gathered on Queen's Gambit. Then, I implemented such information architecture
using html. Finally, I added css declarations to the html with a color palette generated 
by Coolors.
